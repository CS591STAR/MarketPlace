# MarketPlace
CS 591 Final Project: MarketPlace

To test the Redline API, open the `ZipCodeAPI` class (app/java/com.example.marketplace/ZipCodeAPI). As you can see on line 76, We
are pulling the API key from a gitignore file that lives in the same folder as the `ZipCodeAPI` file.

When you run the app, click on the `Check Zipcodes` button to open the ZipCodeAPI activity. Then, enter two zip codes in the 
EditText boxes and find their distance by clicking on the `Check Distance` button. Then, you will see the response from the API.
